            Main character - Altair (Altaïr Ibn-LaʼAhad). Altair is the ancestor
            (on the mother's side) of Desmond Miles. He was born in Assassin
            family in 1165, when the Brotherhood was not operating in secret,
            and was raised and trained by the Assassin leader Al Mualim after
            the death of his parents. After being forced to kill Al-Mualim for
            betraying the Assassins, Altaïr replaced him and reformed the
            Brotherhood after seeing how corrupt it had become. During his later
            travels, he also made several important discoveries that would
            benefit future generations of Assassins and further establish Altaïr
            as a legendary figure in the Brotherhood's history. At the end of
            his life, Altaïr ensured the continued secret existence of the
            Brotherhood by dividing it into several smaller guilds around the
            world, and built a library under Castle Masyaf to store his
            knowledge and his most powerful artifact: the Apple of Eden, which
            he devoted most of his life to protecting and studying . Altair died
            in 1257 in his library, which was discovered only a century later,
            in 1512, by the Italian assassin Ezio Auditore da Firenze.

            Main character - Ezio Auditore da Firenze. He was the ancestor of
            the other main characters: Desmond Miles and Object 16 (Clay
            Kaczmarek, the assassin who wos kidnapped by Abstergo before
            Desmond). Ezio did not suspect his further fate until he reached the
            age of seventeen, but the conspiracy against the Auditore family and
            the subsequent punishment in the form of the execution of his father
            and two brothers did their job: the protagonist was able to learn
            his destiny by finding the original outfit in the chest of the
            father of House Auditore, in a secret room, and going on the path of
            a long and bloody revenge. Actually, this is where the story of Ezio
            Auditore da Firenze begins

            Release date - 2010 <br />
            Years of events in the game - (1499 - 1507) <br />
            After the events of the previous game, Desmond Miles, Lucy Stillman,
            and others flee from the Templars who attacked their hideout and set
            up a new base in the ruins of Villa Auditore in Monteriggioni. After
            restoring electricity to the tunnels beneath the villa, Desmond uses
            the Animus 2.0 to continue reliving the genetic memories of his
            ancestor Ezio Auditore. His mission is to find the Apple of Eden
            that could prevent the impending disaster caused by the Templars.
            <br />
            The story of Ezio continues in 1499. Returning to Monterigioni, the
            wounded Ezio goes to Rome after the death of Mario (Ezio's uncle) at
            the hands of Cesare Borgia. There he restores the former power of
            the Assassin order. Over the next three years, Ezio destroys the
            power of the Borgias and becomes the leader of the Assassins in
            Italy. After learning of Ezio's actions, Cesare confronts his
            father, and later kills him. After learning the location of the
            Apple, Ezio retrieves it and uses it to defeat Cesare's forces.
            Cesare is arrested and thrown into prison. Years later, Ezio uses
            the Apple again to find Cesare, who has escaped from prison. Having
            hidden the Apple, Ezio leaves Italy in pursuit of Cesare. In 1507,
            Cesare laid siege to the city of Viana in Spain. Ezio confronts
            Cesare on the battlements of a crumbling castle and throws him from
            the battlements to his death.
            <br />
            Using the coordinates from Ezio's memories, Desmond, Lucy, Shawn,
            and Rebecca head to the Temple where Ezio hid the Apple, intending
            to use it to find the other Temples and keep the Pieces of Eden they
            contain out of reach of the Templars. As Desmond enters the Temple,
            he encounters holographic visions of a woman named Juno. She
            comments on humanity's lack of knowledge, calling it "innocent and
            ignorant" before suddenly becoming enraged and shouting, "We should
            have left you as you were!" As Desmond approaches the Apple and
            touches it, time freezes around him. Juno declares that Desmond is
            of her race and is their enemy; she also says that there is a woman
            who will accompany him through the "gate" but she cannot be allowed.
            She takes control of Desmond's body and forces him to hit Lucy. Both
            fall to the ground, Lucy dead and Desmond in a coma. During the
            credits, the two men can be heard debating whether or not Desmond
            should be returned to the Animus.

            Years of events in the game - (1511 – 1512) <br />
            After the events of the previous game, Rebecca takes a comatose
            Desmond to his father William Miles in New York. To save Desmond's
            sanity, they place him in the Animus safe mode, the "Black Room".
            Waking up on Animus Island, Desmond encounters the mind of Clay
            Kaczmarek, a previous test subject of the Animus Abstergo, who
            explains that Desmond must regain his mind by fully reliving the
            memories of his ancestors, after which the Animus can separate
            Desmond from his ancestors and awaken him. Desmond returns to Ezio,
            who in 1511 travels to the former Assassin stronghold of Masiaf to
            learn more about their secrets. He finds Masiaf occupied by Templars
            trying to execute him. Ezio escapes and finds the entrance to an
            underground library built by Altaïr, which requires five "keys" to
            open. The Templars found one key, and are looking for the rest in
            Constantinople. Ezio learns that Niccolò Polo hid the keys. Suleiman
            asks Ezio to investigate the Byzantine Templars, whom he suspects of
            involvement in the feud. Ezio learns that Manuel Palaeologus, with
            the support of the Templars, is trying to raise an army to overthrow
            the Ottomans and restore the Byzantine Empire. Ezio travels to
            Cappadocia, kills Manuel and returns the last key, only to learn
            that Ahmet is the true mastermind of the Templar plot to open
            Altair's library. During these events, Ezio uses the keys to see
            different moments in Altair's life. He learns that Altair, after
            killing his traitorous mentor, took over and attempted to reform the
            Assassins, only to be challenged by his former friend Abbas Sofian.
            Abbas staged a coup and executed his youngest son Altair. Altaïr
            sought revenge, but was later forced to go into exile. Later killed
            Abbas and regained leadership of the Assassins. Years later, Altaïr
            encoded his memories into the keys before entrusting them to
            Niccolo.
            <br />Back in Constantinople, Ezio learns that Ahmet has killed
            Yusuf and kidnapped Sofia, demanding the keys in exchange for her.
            Ezio agrees, but after rescuing Sofia, he pursues Ahmet and returns
            the keys. After this memory is finished, the Animus starts deleting
            redundant data. Clay sacrifices himself to save Desmond from being
            taken out. Ezio and Sophia return to Masiaf, where Ezio opens
            Altair's library, finding it empty except for Altair's skeleton and
            the sixth key. Using the key, Ezio learns that the library was a
            vault meant to house Altair's Apple of Eden, and that Altair sealed
            himself away to protect it. Ezio leaves the Apple there, stating
            that he has seen enough for one lifetime, and speaks directly to
            Desmond, knowing that he is watching. He tells Desmond that he
            realizes that he is nothing more than a carrier of a message and
            hopes that Desmond can find answers to his questions. With that,
            Ezio walks away from the Assassins. <br />Desmond is approached by
            Jupiter, a member of the First Civilization. He explains that his
            race has learned methods to save the planet from destruction and has
            transmitted all the collected data to the central repository, the
            Great Temple. Jupiter tells Desmond that he must find the Temple
            before the inevitable solar flare hits Earth and kills all of
            humanity. Awakening from his coma, Desmond finds Rebecca, Sean, and
            William by his side and tells them that he knows what they must do
            when they arrive at the Great Temple. <br />Fun Fact : While in the
            Black Room of the Animus, Desmond unwittingly relives Clay
            Kaczmarek's memories, learning more about his life. Clay recalls how
            his father neglected his career goals, demanding that Clay instead
            become an engineer to provide for his family. Clay believed that his
            father's focus on wealth pushed his mother away from the family.
            Clay eventually joined the Assassins and was sent to infiltrate
            Abstergo Industries' Animus Project Lab in Rome and learn what
            Warren Weedick hoped to accomplish by examining the genetic memories
            of various Assassins. Lucy Stillman, an assassin herself, was
            stationed at the facility to save Clay when his mission was
            accomplished. Clay eventually realized that Vidic was using these
            genetic memories to discover the locations of different parts of
            Eden around the world. In particular, Vidic focused on finding the
            Apple of Eden, which was meant to be launched aboard a satellite to
            control the minds of the entire human race. Clay also witnessed Lucy
            discussing her true loyalty to the Templars with Vidic and revealed
            her true motives, which were to remove Desmond from the Abstergo
            facility and transport him to a more comfortable environment where
            she would utilize the Assassins' resources. to detect location.
            Apples and return it to the Templars. After discovering that Clay
            had learned of her betrayal, Lucy erased the security data that
            showed he had witnessed her conversation with Vidic and left Clay
            imprisoned in Abstergo.

            Years of events in the game - (1754 – 1783) <br />
            Following the events of the previous game, Desmond, William,
            Rebecca, and Sean find the Great Temple of the First Civilization.
            Desmond enters the Animus and experiences memories of his ancestor,
            Hayatham Kenway. In 1754 Haytham steals a Piece of Eden. After
            learning that the key is for the inner chambers of the Temple,
            Desmond returns to the memories of Ratonnhacketon, son of Haitham.
            In 1769, the village headman informs the Assassin that it is their
            tribe's duty to prevent the opening of the Temple, and gives him an
            Orb that allows Juno to communicate with him. The Assassin renames
            himself "Connor" to move around the colonies more freely. In the
            years that followed, Connor was drawn into the American Revolution
            and the Revolutionary War. Connor meets his father and they work
            together to take down the rogue Templar. Haytham reveals that
            Washington ordered the attack that killed Conor's mother. Desmond
            retrieves the batteries to activate the Temple while Templar Daniel
            Cross hunts him down. Connor seeks the destruction of the Templars
            and he hopes to work with his father for peace and freedom. Haytham,
            however, has other ideas. Connor is forced to kill his father. In
            the end, Connor returns the key, and buries it in the grave of
            Achilles' son, Connor Davenport. Desmond retrieves the key and gains
            access to the inner chambers of the Temple, where Juno reveals that
            she can save the world at the cost of her own life. Minerva appears
            and opposes the plan as it would free Juno, who was sealed away in
            the Temple to prevent her from conquering humanity. Juno explains
            that if the solar flare happens, Desmond will be a messiah to the
            other survivors and will be worshiped as a god after his death, but
            his legacy will be manipulated to control future generations.
            Desmond decides to sacrifice himself to save humanity and give them
            a chance to fight Juno.

            from Desmond's body allowed the research to continue. The unnamed
            player character is hired by Abstergo to study the memories of
            Desmond's ancestor Edward Kenway, the Abstergos search for a First
            Civilization structure known as the Observatory in Edward's
            memories. A group of infamous pirates—including Blackbeard, Benjamin
            Hornigold, Mary Reed, and Charles Vane—dream of a pirate utopia.
            With the help of Edward, they found a pirate republic. However,
            mismanagement, a lack of economy, and an outbreak of disease bring
            the republic closer to collapse, and the founders are divided.
            Edward tries to settle the dispute but is too late, Blackbeard is
            killed by the British, Hornigold joins the Templars, and Vane goes
            mad after Jack Rackham's mutiny. Eventually, Edward discovers the
            location of the Observatory. Edward is betrayed by his partner, and
            the British arrest him. He is imprisoned but escapes when the
            assassin's mentor infiltrates the prison to rescue Mary Reed and
            Anne Bonny. Edward soon decides to join the Brotherhood. He receives
            a letter announcing the death of his wife and the imminent arrival
            of his as yet unknown daughter, Jennifer Scott. Edward returns to
            England, promising to continue the fight against the Templars. Years
            later, Edward visits the Royal Opera House with Jennifer and his son
            Haytham (the future Templar and father of Conor from the third part
            of the game. In the present, John Standish convinces the player to
            investigate what their employers are trying to hide from them. They
            steal the information and pass it on to Rebecca Crane and others.
            With the facility locked down after the hacks were discovered, Jon
            orders the player to access the Animus Core, whereupon Juno
            materializes in an incorporeal form. She reveals that the world is
            not ready for her and that she cannot possess the player as her
            agents planned. John reveals himself to be the reincarnated Sage and
            tries to kill the player to cover up Juno's botched resurrection,
            but is killed by Abstergo's guards, who accuse him of trespassing.
            The Sage confesses to Edward that he owes no allegiance to the
            Assassins or the Templars and instead uses those who represent the
            best chance for him to achieve his goals.

            Years of events in the game - (1752 – 1760) <br />
            In 1752, Shay Patrick Cormack becomes a recruit under Assassin
            mentor Achilles Davenport. Adewale's killer arrives with the news
            that Port-au-Prince has been destroyed by an earthquake. Shay begins
            to question the Assassins' motives after they refuse to engage in
            dialogue with the Templars, instead ordering Shay to kill them no
            matter what. In 1754, Shay inadvertently causes a devastating
            earthquake while trying to remove a certain artifact. Concluding
            that Port-au-Prince had been similarly destroyed, Shay learned that
            Achilles intended to continue his search for the Forerunner
            artifacts, putting more lives at risk. He steals the manuscript with
            the map, but the Brotherhood shoots Shay before he destroys the
            manuscript. Colonel George Monroe finds Shay, rescues him and leaves
            him with the Templars in New York. After recovering in 1756, Shay
            agrees to help his newfound Templar allies. Shay realizes that the
            Brotherhood has not stopped searching for the temples of the
            Forerunners, and begins to hunt down its former members Over the
            next three years, Shay kills many Assassins leaving only two:
            Achilles and Liam O'Brien, once Shay's best friend. Shay and Haitham
            Kenway (son of Edward Kenway) pursue the Assassins and eliminate the
            expeditions. Shay and Haytham find Liam and Achilles. During the
            battle, the artifact is destroyed, causing another earthquake. As
            the four escape, Shay fatally wounds Liam and Haytham defeats
            Achilles. Achilles is left alive In 1776, after the murder of
            Charles Dorian, Shay receives a chest of manuscripts. Shay calls for
            a revolution against the Assassins In the present day, the player is
            an unnamed employee of Abstergo Entertainment tasked with
            investigating Shai's memories. While investigating, the player
            inadvertently discovers a hidden memory file that infects the Animus
            servers. Abstergo is shut down and the player must clear the Animus
            servers while living on Shay's memories. Juhani Otso Berg (Andreas
            Apergis), a senior Templar, orders the player to upload Shai's
            memories to the Assassins' servers to weaken their resolve. The
            Brotherhood responds by disconnecting. During the mid-credits, Berg
            thanks the player for their help and gives them a choice: join the
            Templars or die. The player's decision is not disclosed.

            Years of events in the game - (1789 – 1794) <br />
            In 2014, Abstergo releases Helix software, which allows access to
            the genetic memory of anyone The player relives the memories of
            Arnaud Dorian, a Franco-Austrian nobleman. Left an orphan in 1776
            after the murder of his father (Shayom from the previous part), Arno
            was brought up by the Master of the French Templars. In 1789, Arnaud
            was framed for the murder of de la Serre and imprisoned in the
            Bastille, where he befriended Pierre Bellec, who knew his father.
            Bellec invites Arno to the Brotherhood of Assassins after they
            escape during the storming of the Bastille. Arno joins the
            Brotherhood to eliminate the Templars behind de la Serra's death.
            During his investigation, Arnaud rescues Francois-Thomas Germain, a
            silversmith, and kills Lafreniere, a Templar who was holding
            Francois hostage. Arno convinces Eliza (former girlfriend) to enter
            into negotiations with the Brotherhood. Mentor Mirabeau agrees to
            help, hoping to bring about peace between the Orders, but is killed
            by Bellec, who was trying to purge the Assassin leadership. Arno is
            forced to kill Bellec. Arno realizes that there is a mass rebellion
            against the king, and kills the Templars who are involved and
            restores his relationship with his girlfriend. In the midst of the
            revolution, Arnaud tracks down Germaine the Templar, but decides to
            protect Elise rather than pursue him. Arno is expelled from the
            Brotherhood for his reckless actions. Arno finds Elise in
            Versailles, who convinces him to return. Arnaud discredits
            Maximilien Robespierre, whom Germain has assigned to maintain chaos.
            After Arnaud and Elise find Robespierre, Elise forces him to write
            down Germaine's location. Arnaud confronts Germaine, who has been
            empowered by de Molay's sword—the Sword of Eden—and pursues him to
            the Templar crypt beneath the Paris Cathedral, with Elise soon
            arriving to help. After Arno is temporarily incapacitated, Elise
            tries to deal with Germaine herself, but the Sword explodes, killing
            Elise and mortally wounding Germaine. Arnaud kills Germain, who
            confirms that he is the Sage and that he wanted to cleanse the
            Templars who had forgotten the teachings of de Molay. The game ends
            with Arno explaining how his understanding of the Creed has changed
            and promising to keep Elise's memory alive. Many years later, Arnaud
            finds Germaine's skeleton and places it in the Paris catacombs. The
            player is relieved, confident that Abstergo won't be able to find
            him.

            Years of events in the game - 1868 <br />
            In 2015, Bishop once again contacted the player Helix, now a
            dedicated assassin, to help the Brotherhood find the Piece of Eden
            in London. In 1868, Evie infiltrates a laboratory run by David
            Brewster and Templar occultist Lucy Thorne and finds them
            experimenting with the Apple of Eden. Evie kills Brewster after
            learning that the Templars are looking for another artifact in
            London and escapes the lab after the Apple explodes. The Fry twins
            head to London to stop the Templars from finding this piece of Eden
            and meet their fellow assassin Henry Green. Henry informs them that
            the Brotherhood of London has fallen and the city is controlled by
            the Knights Templar, led by Crawford Starrick, a powerful figure in
            the city's industrial and criminal underworld. Even though Evie
            wants to find a Piece of Eden, Jacob convinces her to help free
            London neighborhoods from Templar gangs. In the process, they form
            their own gang, the Grachi, and find allies such as Clara O'Dea,
            Frederick Ebberlein, Alexander Graham Bell, Charles Darwin, Charles
            Dickens, Ned Wienert and Edward Hodson Bailey. During this time,
            Jacob, seeking to undermine Starrick's control over London society,
            kills Starrick's allies, including Dr. John Elliotson, who oversaw
            the production of the addictive tonic; Malcolm Milner, owner of
            Starrick's Omnibus; Pearl Attaway, Starrick's cousin and owner of a
            rival omnibus company; Philip Tupenny, manager of the Bank of
            England, who secretly robbed it; James Brudenell, 7th Earl of
            Cardigan, who plotted to assassinate Prime Minister Benjamin
            Disraeli; and gang leader Maxwell Roth, who initially supports Jacob
            but later turns out to be a dangerous sadist. Meanwhile, Evie
            searches for the Piece of Eden with Henry's help. Following clues
            under Edward Kenway's mansion, they find the key to the Shroud's
            vault, but Thorne steals it and heads for the Tower of London. Evie
            infiltrates the Tower and kills Thorne, who discovers that the
            Shroud is not there. Henry believes that the vault is hidden in
            Buckingham Palace, and enlists the help of Maharajah Dulip Singh to
            obtain plans for the building; however, the Templars capture them
            first. Evie also fixes the effects of Jacob's murder, such as drug
            shortages and currency inflation. With his lieutenants dead,
            Starrick sets out to retrieve the Shroud and destroy Britain's heads
            of church and state. Jacob and Evie argue over his recklessness and
            her inaction, but agree to work together to stop Starrick. They
            infiltrate a ball at Buckingham Palace, but Starrick beats them to
            the vault and retrieves the Shroud. With Henry's help, the Fry twins
            kill Starrick before reconciling and returning the Shroud to the
            vault. For their merits, Queen Victoria knighted twins Fry and
            Henry. Rebecca and Shawn are now spying on a meeting between senior
            Templars Isabel Ardan and Alvaro Grammatica, who are also looking
            for the Shroud. They try to capture Ardant, but are forced to flee
            after being attacked by Otso Berg and Violet da Costa. After the
            Initiate finds the Shroud, Shawn, Rebecca, and fellow assassin
            Galina Voronina head to the vault, only to find Ardan, Berg, and da
            Costa ahead of them. A fight begins, in which Ardan dies, and da
            Costa escapes with the Shroud. Hacking Ardant's computer, the
            Assassins learn that the Templars plan to use the Shroud to create a
            living Forerunner. They also learn that Juno is manipulating
            employees at Abstergo to sabotage the company and has her own plans
            for the Shroud.

            Layla Hassan, a researcher at Abstergo Industries, is tasked with
            retrieving the artifact in Egypt on their behalf. Instead, she finds
            a tomb containing the mummified body of Bayec of Siwa, a former
            Egyptian Medea who lived at the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty. Layla
            secretly uses the Animus to relive Bayek's memories. She learns that
            Bayek has begun a campaign to kill the five people responsible for
            his son's death who are trying to gain control of the Pieces of Eden
            In 49 BC e. Bayek and his son Hema are kidnapped by a group of
            masked people. The men give Bayek a dormant Piece of Eden and demand
            that he discover a secret vault. While struggling with one of the
            masked men, Bayek inadvertently kills Hema. Bayek seeks revenge and
            tracks down the five men to kill them. Bayek heads to Alexandria to
            see his wife, Aya, and tracks down the last of his targets. Layla
            realizes that Aya will be buried in the same tomb as Bayek and
            collects a DNA sample from her remains to read her memories at the
            same time. The couple goes to meet Cleopatra VII. She confirms that
            the masked men are members of the Order of the Ancients, who are
            responsible for the coup and setting Ptolemy against her. Cleopatra
            gives Bayek four new targets, which he tracks down and kills. Aia
            negotiates an alliance with the Roman general Pompey, who is waging
            a civil war against Julius Caesar. Bayek begins to believe that
            Cleopatra is using him to kill her rivals. Abstergo then kills
            Layla's medical assistant and sends staff to kill Layla, but Layla
            kills them. Having heard that Caesar is in Egypt, Cleopatra decides
            to negotiate an alliance with him. Bayek and Aia sneak Cleopatra
            into the palace to meet with Caesar, whom she impresses and gains
            his support. Caesar's support enables Cleopatra's forces to win a
            civil war against Ptolemy, who is killed while trying to escape
            across the Nile. Bayec kills Potinus, the Ptolemaic regent, but
            Caesar prevents him from killing Septimius. Cleopatra takes the
            throne as pharaoh and breaks ties with Bayek and Aia, and Septimius
            becomes Caesar's adviser. Bayek realizes that Cleopatra and Caesar
            have now joined the Order and gathers his allies to form a
            brotherhood. Bayek and Aya realize that the Order has shown interest
            in the tomb of Alexander the Great. Back at Siwa, Bayek discovers
            that Flavius and Septimius have opened a vault and are using the
            Pieces of Eden to control Siwa's people. Bayek kills Flavius and
            returns to Aia. Aia reveals that she plans to go to Rome, where
            Septimius is headed, and has joined Brutus and Cassius' plot to kill
            Caesar. Reconciled with reality, Bayek and Aya end their
            relationship, but form the Hidden Ones—a precursor to the
            Brotherhood of Assassins—vowing to protect the world from the
            shadows. Layla was awakened by William Miles, the mentor of the
            assassins and the father of the deceased Desmond Miles. He reveals
            that the assassins have been watching her research and offers her to
            work with them. She does not agree to join them, but agrees to go to
            Alexandria with Miles. In Rome, Aia confronts and kills Septimius,
            who wields the staff of Eden. She infiltrates the Roman Senate and
            kills Caesar with a knife, followed by several senators. She later
            meets Cleopatra and warns her to be a just ruler or she will come
            back to kill her.

            to be alive. After this meeting, Cassandra goes to Phocis to find
            her mother's whereabouts. The Oracle tells her about the so-called
            "Space Cult" and its plan to destroy Cassandra's family. Later,
            Cassandra sneaks into a cult meeting where she learns about a
            superior warrior named "Deimos". Some time later, Deimos arrives
            with the head of Elpenor (the one who ordered the murder of
            Cassandra's father), revealing that he knows there is a traitor in
            his ranks. He forces various cultists to touch a mysterious
            pyramid-shaped artifact in the center of the room to expose the
            traitor. When it's Cassandra's turn, the artifact reveals that
            Deimos is her brother Alexios, whom she thought was dead. Deimos
            releases Cassandra and kills the closest member of the cult, whom he
            considers a traitor. On the island of Andros, Cassandra opens a
            mysterious gate with the Spear of Leonidas and enters a large vault,
            which turns out to be an ancient First Civilization forge. As
            Cassandra emerges from the vault, she runs into Deimos. He accuses
            her of intentionally throwing him off the mountain at that time.
            Cassandra tries to explain the truth to Deimos, but his cult
            indoctrination is too strong and he leaves his sister. A little
            later, Cassandra arrives in Athens, where she meets new allies such
            as Alcibiades, Socrates and Aspasia. After completing some errands
            in the city, she wins the trust of Pericles, who then invites her to
            his symposium. At the symposium, Cassandra hopes to learn more about
            her mother.
            <br />
            Cassandra finds all the clues about her mother, she returns to
            Athens, where soon after the guards of the cult appear and massacre
            the city. Cassandra fights back and sails to Naxos, where she can
            finally find her mother Meereen. Mirrin sends her daughter to the
            island of Santorini. In Santorini, Cassandra meets her real father,
            who turns out to be Pythagoras. He explains to her that they are in
            the remains of Atlantis and instructs her to recover four artifacts
            of Eden hidden throughout Greece to seal Atlantis forever. The story
            then returns to the present. Leila goes to Santorini and arrives at
            the ruins of Atlantis, but cannot find the Staff of Hermes there.
            After meeting Pythagoras, Cassandra meets Myrrhina in Sparta.
            Archidamus instructs them to help the Spartan troops conquer
            Boeotia. In Boeotia, Cassandra helps the Spartans defeat the
            Athenians. A little later, she learns from Brasidas that Deimos is
            fighting alongside the Athenian forces at Pylos and destroying the
            Spartan troops. Then Cassandra, together with Brasides, breaks
            through to Messenia, where a battle takes place between the
            Athenians and the Spartans. Deimos appears in the battle and attacks
            his sister. The duel is interrupted when Cassandra is knocked
            unconscious by a fallen tree. Cassandra wakes up in a prison in
            Athens, where Deimos is guarding her by her cell. Cassandra manages
            to escape from prison. Together with Socrates, Alcibiades, Herodotus
            and Hippocrates, they manage to expose Cleon's insidious
            machinations to the inhabitants, which caused his popularity to
            fall. At Amphipolis, the final battle takes place between Cleon's
            army and the Spartans. Cassandra supports the Spartans, attacks and
            kills Cleon. Back in Sparta, Cassandra and her mother travel to
            Mount Taygete, where it all began. There they suddenly see Deimos
            standing by a rock. Mirrin begs her son to leave the cult and return
            to the family. However, Deimos shares his belief that he is chosen
            and has a purpose. The outcome of the situation depends on which
            path the player chooses and which important decisions have already
            been made: Cassandra kills Deimos in a final duel after repeatedly
            telling Mirrin that he cannot be saved anymore. Cassandra kills
            Deimos, after which Mirryn breaks off her relationship, as her
            daughter had previously promised to save him. Deimos kills Mirrin,
            after which Cassandra kills him in a final duel. Deimos lays down
            his arms and reconciles with Cassandra and Mirrina after being
            persuaded to leave the cult. The evening after this event, all
            family members who survived due to the player's choice gather for
            dinner together at their home in Sparta. After completing the main
            story, Cassandra finds all the artifacts and will return to Atlantis
            where she will place the artifacts in the appropriate devices.
            Pythagoras discovers that the Rod of Hermes is the key to sealing
            Atlantis. He reluctantly hands it over to Cassandra, thereby also
            sacrificing his own life.
            <br />
            The game returns to the present, Layla reactivating the devices in
            the Atlantis Vault. Cassandra herself appears, kept alive by the
            Wand of Paradise. Cassandra warns Layla that the world needs a
            balance between order and chaos, between Templars and Assassins.
            Layla is said to have been prophesied to bring order and chaos into
            balance, so Cassandra hands her a magic wand and eventually dies in
            her arms.
